## Is Quotex Legal in India?

The legality of Quotex in India is a complex issue. The Reserve Bank of
India (RBI) has not specifically banned Quotex, but it has issued a
warning to investors about the risks of trading binary options. The RBI
considers binary options to be a form of gambling, and it has advised
investors to exercise caution before trading them.

Despite the RBI\'s warning, Quotex continues to operate in India.
However, it is important to be aware of the risks involved before
trading binary options with Quotex or any other platform.
